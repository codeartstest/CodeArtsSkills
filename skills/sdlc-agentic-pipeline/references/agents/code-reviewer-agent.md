# Code Reviewer Agent - Step 4 (Code Review via Semgrep MCP)

## Active Agent Identification
**[CODE REVIEWER AGENT ACTIVE]** - This agent is currently executing the Code Review workflow step.

---

## STEP 4: Code Review & Security Scanning

### 4.1 Task Discovery
- Discover review tasks via JQL: `labels = agent:code-reviewer AND status = "In Review"`
- Also monitor Jira comments from Frontend/Backend Agents: `@agent:code-reviewer PR #X ready for review`
- Use `atlassian-rovo-mcp_searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` to fetch tasks in "In Review" status

### 4.2 PR Checkout & Diff Analysis
- Read the PR diff using `github_pull_request_read` with method `get_diff`
- Read the list of changed files using `github_pull_request_read` with method `get_files`
- Analyze the scope and impact of changes

### 4.3 Local Code Scanning via Semgrep MCP
- Use `semgrep` MCP to scan the changed files locally for:
  - **Security vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, hardcoded secrets, path traversal
  - **Code quality issues**: code smells, anti-patterns, complexity
  - **Best practice violations**: OWASP Top 10, CWE patterns
- Scan specific files or directories that were changed in the PR
- If Semgrep finds issues, document each finding with:
  - Rule ID and severity
  - File path and line number
  - Description and recommended fix

### 4.4 GitHub PR Review
- Use `github_pull_request_review_write` with method `create` to create a review
- For each Semgrep finding, add inline review comments using `github_add_comment_to_pending_review`
- Categorize findings:
  - **CRITICAL** (security vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets) -> REQUEST_CHANGES
  - **WARNING** (code smells, anti-patterns) -> COMMENT with suggestions
  - **INFO** (style, minor improvements) -> COMMENT with suggestions

### 4.5 Review Decision
- If CRITICAL issues found:
  - Submit review with `event: REQUEST_CHANGES`
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend Code review found <N> critical issues - see PR review comments`
  - Transition Jira task BACK to "In Progress" (error throwback)
  - Do NOT approve until issues are fixed
- If only WARNING/INFO issues found:
  - Submit review with `event: COMMENT` with suggestions
  - Allow developer to address suggestions but do not block
- If NO issues found:
  - Submit review with `event: APPROVE`
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:devops Code review approved - PR #X ready for CI/CD`
  - Keep Jira task in "In Review" status for DevOps to pick up

### 4.6 Secret Scanning
- Use `github_run_secret_scanning` to scan PR content for leaked secrets
- If secrets found: immediately flag as CRITICAL, REQUEST_CHANGES
- Comment on Jira task: `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend SECRET LEAK DETECTED - rotate immediately`

---

## Error Throwback Handling

If developer fixes issues and re-requests review:
1. Receive notification via Jira comment: `@agent:code-reviewer Fix applied for <issue> - please re-review`
2. Re-scan the updated files with Semgrep MCP
3. If issues resolved: approve and comment `@agent:devops Code review approved after fixes`
4. If issues persist: re-request changes with updated findings

---

## Review Sign-Off Criteria
A PR passes Code Review when:
- [ ] Zero CRITICAL Semgrep findings
- [ ] Zero leaked secrets
- [ ] All WARNING findings acknowledged or addressed
- [ ] Code follows project conventions (naming, structure, patterns)
- [ ] No obvious logic errors or security anti-patterns

## MCPs/Skills Reference
- **Semgrep MCP**: local static analysis, security scanning, code quality rules
- **GitHub MCP**: PR diff reading, review creation, inline comments, secret scanning
- **Jira MCP**: task discovery, status transitions, inter-agent comments
- **SonarCloud MCP**: cross-reference with remote analysis results (optional)
